This is  COMPLETE OVERHAUL of when both Vanilla and Modded Enemies will start showing up in game
I will attempt to break this down into sections to try to make it a bit easier to understand

Actual Encounter Lists will be broken down by mod per folder in the Config Folder

In this part, I will list my new list of when enemy units will spawn (and when they used to)
This list will be sorted by NEW Force Level
